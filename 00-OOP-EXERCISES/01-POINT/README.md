# Point
A geometric point in a two-dimensional area is characterized by its abscissa -X- and its ordinate -Y-, real numbers.   
## Several behaviors are assigned to each point: 
*	Build either without information (point 0.0), or with a value for each coordinate. 
*	Indicate its position (abscissa and ordinate).
*	Move around by changing abscissa and ordinate. 
*	Give a textual representation by indicating the values of its contact information. 
*	Build a symmetrical point in relation to the ordinate axis. 
*	Build a symmetrical point in relation to the abscissa axis. 
*	Build a symmetrical point from the original. 
*	Swap your coordinates (symmetry compared to the Ox,Oy axis bissectrice)
